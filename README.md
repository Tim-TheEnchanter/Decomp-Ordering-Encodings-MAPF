# Decomp-Ordering-Encodings-MAPF
This repo will include the encodings -- written or altered by me -- that I intend to use for my Bachelor Thesis about "Decomposition and Ordering Strategies for the Multi-Agent Pathfinding Problem" 
---

To illustrate the usage of these encodings here an examplary workflow:

  The file ```action-m.lp``` is an extended version of the **ASPRILO** encoding which uses heuristical values to support the pathfinding process. For that an input of the form: ```priority(R,P)``` where P is a priority-score for robot R.
